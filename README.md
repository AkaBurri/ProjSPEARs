# ProjSPEARs
Codes of the SPEAR paper from Lai / Ko labs.
The scripts in this repository were used to produce parts of the data and figures in the associated manuscript. 
Apart from MATLAB, the codes do not require other installations (hence there is no installation time with the use).
They are available for use freely by individual users for non-commerical purposes under the GNU GPL version 3.0.
