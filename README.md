# ProjSPEARs
Codes of the SPEAR paper from Lai / Ko labs.
The scripts in this repository were used to produce parts of the data and figures in the associated manuscript. 
Apart from MATLAB (we used different versions during the project which took years, but all codes are compatible with / can be run in R2021a), the codes do not require other installations (hence there is no installation time with the use).
Tested on
- Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
- Processor: AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3955WX 16-Cores 3.89 GHz
- Installed RAM: 256 GB 
- Graphic processing unit: NVIDIA RTX 3090
Instructions for use and expected output are described in the codes and readme files in the respective subfolders.
They are available for use freely by individual users for non-commerical purposes under the GNU GPL version 3.0.
